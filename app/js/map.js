   So they are dropped, not queued: they describe a transient state that has already moved on by

   share one failure: a different name means a different text, which defeats toastMsg's
   identical-text dedupe AND its (target, type, first 40 chars) cooldown key, so every layer gets
   through — and the FIFO cap of two then tears the older ones out the instant the next arrives,
   with no fade. Measured with the five layers from the field report: 5 inserted, 3 torn out,
   2 left standing. Collected, the same burst is one toast.
   ⚠ Deliberately ONE mechanism with four renderings, not four copies of the same window: the
   first two were written separately and the other two were then left behind for days, which is
   exactly how four copies drift apart.
   The per-layer throttles (8 s on the empty view, 5 s on the below-scale notice) stay upstream
   where they already were: they are what stops the COUNT changing on every pan, which would mint
   a new cooldown key each time and walk straight past the rate limit this leans on.
   The window is a UI-latency choice, not a measured quantity — the layers are scheduled by one
   moveend so their requests leave together, but their replies arrive a network round trip apart
   and that spread cannot be measured from here. It degrades safely: a reply that misses the
   window opens the next one, so the worst case is two toasts rather than five. */

/* These messages describe a STATE, not an event: "no features here" stays true until the user
   moves, and "below this scale" until they zoom. A state is worth saying when it CHANGES —
   saying it again every cooldown, for as long as it holds, is what the field reported as
   "troppi e ripetuti". toastMsg's dedupe only merges toasts visible at the same moment, and its
   cooldown just delays the repeat by 8 s; neither stops a message recurring for ever while
   nothing about the situation has changed. So the collector remembers what it last said and
   stays quiet until the answer is different.
   Two escapes keep the silence from becoming a hole: `reset()`, called when the condition
   actually clears (features come back, the zoom rises above the layer's minimum), so the same
   message can be said again for a NEW occurrence; and _SAY_AGAIN_MS, after which it may repeat
   anyway — a user coming back to the same spot ten minutes later has forgotten being told. */
/* ⚠ NO reset() calls anywhere. An earlier version cleared the memo whenever the condition
   "ended" — features came back, the zoom rose above a layer's minimum — so that a new occurrence
   would be heard rather than swallowed as a repeat. It backfired badly and was reported from the
   device as the same toast firing many times in a fraction of a second: the resets were GLOBAL
   and fired constantly. With eleven layers at different minZooms there is always one above its
   threshold, so `_reportBelowScale.reset()` in _update wiped the memo on essentially every
   update; and one layer answering with features re-armed the empty message for all the others.
   The message then became formally "new" many times a second, and no downstream rate limit could
   catch it, because none of them was wrong.
   What remains is enough and is predictable: the text itself is the memo, so the message speaks
   again as soon as the ANSWER changes (a different count, a different layer), and _SAY_AGAIN_MS
   lets it be heard again after a minute for a genuinely new visit. */

/* Vector geometry is not re-projected while the map is being turned BY HAND.
   The overlay SVG stores screen pixels, not coordinates, so a new bearing invalidates every
   path: measured on the bench with 120 polygons over a 40-frame gesture, the renderer rewrites
   the `d` of EVERY path on EVERY frame — 4800 attribute writes, against 28 on the WMS images
   in the same gesture. That is the work that leaves the layer above the map lagging behind the
   tiles, which move on the compositor; it looks like everything flickering at once.
   Detaching the rendered features for the duration takes it to 0 during the gesture and costs
   240 node operations once (120 removals, 120 creations) instead of 4800 spread over frames.
   ⚠ Hiding the pane in CSS does NOT work, and this was measured rather than assumed: Leaflet
   does not know the pane is hidden and keeps rewriting every path — identical 4800. It saves
   the paint, not the work.

   Triggered on the RATE of rotate events, not on an angle. leaflet-rotate has no rotateend and
   fires 'rotate' unconditionally from setBearing, so one event means two very different things:
   a two-finger gesture produces roughly one per frame, track-up navigation roughly one per GPS
   fix. Those regimes are a factor of fifty apart. An angle cannot separate them — a slow bend
   in navigation crosses any sensible threshold, and that is exactly when the cadastre must stay
   on screen.

   Only the WFS features are detached. The WMS overlays stay: they are moved by the pane
   transform and cost almost nothing, and dropping them would empty the map precisely while the
   user is orienting. The GPS marker and accuracy circle stay for the same reason.
   ⚠ The rendered `_geo` is detached, never the `_WFSLayer` itself: removing the layer would run
   its onRemove, clear `_fetchedBounds` and make the restore issue a fresh request — one refetch
   per turn, which is the defect the coverage guard exists to prevent. */

/* The follow pan asks whether the screen actually changes (_FOLLOW_MIN_PX); the bearing never
   did — setBearing was called on every fix, unguarded, while the pan beside it was gated. And
   the smoother is exponential (0.55), so it approaches the true course without ever reaching it:
   a slightly different value every fix, for ever, on top of the degree or two a real GPS course
   wobbles by.
   Same question as the pan, in the same units: how far does the farthest point on screen move?
   At radius r (half the diagonal) a change of d degrees moves it r*d*PI/180 pixels. Below one
   pixel nothing can change on screen, so this is not a trade-off — it removes work that has no
   effect. It sits upstream of the rotation freeze and is still worth having: a call skipped here
   also skips the rotate event, the view save it schedules and the coverage check every WMS layer
   runs on it.
   ⚠ Compared against map.getBearing(), i.e. what is ACTUALLY on screen, never against the
   previous target. Against the previous target a slow drift of a tenth of a degree per fix would
   stay under the threshold for ever and the map would silently accumulate error; against the
   applied bearing the drift adds up and is applied as soon as it becomes visible. It is also
   immune to bearing changes coming from elsewhere — the compass reset, a two-finger gesture. */

/* MEASURED, and it is the whole point: a bearing change never needs the geometry re-projected.
   The overlay pane sits inside the rotate pane, so the pane's own transform already turns every
   path — and the browser routes pointer events through that transform too. Probe of 31/08: with
   the `d` rewriting blocked, a polygon at bearing 45 lands on exactly the same screen pixels as
   with it active (0x0 over 20 blocked writes), a tap still reaches the layer's click handler, and
   a point outside the rotated shape still misses it.
   So the writes triggered BY THE ROTATION are skipped and nothing else is touched: the features
   stay on screen, rotating with the pane, and the per-frame DOM cost disappears. A pan or a zoom
   change the projection for real and still write as they always did — the freeze is only up
   during the synchronous work of the rotate event itself.

   Two earlier designs, both worse, kept here so they are not tried again:
   - detaching the layers for the duration of the gesture. It worked, but made the cadastre
     vanish exactly while the user was orienting — a compromise this does not need.
   - freezing only at gesture rate, then redrawing once the gesture settled. That protected
     track-up navigation from a risk that does not exist, and left it paying the full cost: one
     bearing change per GPS fix, 120 paths rewritten each time. The rate detector, the settle
     window and the deferred redraw are all gone with it.
   The user put the whole thing in one sentence before any of this was measured: "first rotate,
   THEN paste the rest on top — I get the impression you redraw EVERYTHING at every angle". */

/* ===== FRAME PROBE — instrumentation only, nothing acts on it yet =====
   Times how long frames take while the map is DOING something, so that the threshold for a
   future "the app is slowing down" notice can be picked from real numbers rather than guessed.

   Not tied to rotation, and that is the point rather than a convenience. Measuring only while
   the map turns assumes the answer: it can only ever find slowness during a turn, and could
   never report that a pan on the same view is just as slow — which is the one observation that
   would clear rotation of the blame. The speed panel was already suspected the same way and
   turned out to be a victim, not a cause.

   A byte counter would be the wrong instrument regardless: performance.memory reports the JS
   heap alone, and the cost here is DOM nodes, path rewrites and tile bitmaps, none of which
   live there. The vertex editor is the precedent — 16003 nodes and 53 MB of DOM against a heap
   that never moved. (measureUserAgentSpecificMemory would see all of it, but needs cross-origin
   isolation, which a file:// Cordova page cannot have.) Frame time is the symptom the user
   actually feels, so that is what is timed.

   ⚠ Sampling is anchored to ACTIVITY, never to the clock, and a perpetual rAF was rejected for
   a reason that outranks its battery cost: on a still map frames do not arrive because there is
   nothing to draw, not because the app is slow, so an idle sampler would read its own silence as
   a 900 ms frame. Frame time only means anything while rendering work is in flight. In exchange
   the probe costs nothing at rest, and while the map moves it adds no frames — it rides the ones
   already being drawn.

   Shaped after the cache probe in geoapp.html, deliberately: a median, a best-ever baseline kept

/* ===== SERIAL WFS PARSE QUEUE =====
   Thirteen layers used to parse and build all at once, and their parses landed on the same main
   thread within moments of each other: measured on the bench a single 2000-feature reply is
   ~1700 ms, so the pile-up is the multi-second wall the field session ran into. Parsing one at a
   time turns the same total into short blocks the app can breathe between — and combined with the
   chunked build, no single stretch is long enough to read as a freeze.

   ⚠ It is the PARSE that is serialised, never the request. The first version queued _update()
   itself and was wrong in a way worth recording: the network is not what blocks — it runs off the
   main thread — so putting requests in a queue added thirteen server round trips end to end where
   there had been one wait in parallel. On a field connection that trades a freeze for a much
   longer wait, which for the user is not obviously the better deal. So every layer fires its
   request immediately, exactly as before, and only the replies line up to be read.

   Order is the legend's, bottom-up: the layer drawn underneath is parsed first, the way a GIS
   composes a map. It is read from the pane's applied z-index rather than a stored field, because
   that is the value _applyOverlayZOrder has actually put on screen — a copy of the ordering could
   disagree with it, the live value cannot.

   ⚠ The queue must never wedge: a job that neither finishes nor fails would strand every reply
   behind it, which is worse than the pile-up this replaces. Completion is taken from whichever
   comes first — the wfsupdate a finished build fires, an early return, an error, or a watchdog.
   The watchdog is not a fallback for a case nobody thought of; it is what makes it unnecessary
   for that list to be complete. */

/* ===== "YOU ARE ASKING FOR TOO MUCH" NOTICE =====
   The advice this gives is the opposite of the obvious one, which is why it has to be given at
   all. Measurement moved the cost off the drawing path entirely: a pure rotation reads 2.0x the
   device baseline against a pure pan's 3.0x, so turning is CHEAPER than panning. What costs is
   parsing WFS replies — ~1700 ms for a 2000-feature answer on a desktop-class CPU — and it is
   paid again on every move that leaves the fetched box. Told to "switch off overlays", a user
   switches off basemaps, which are free, and keeps the thirteen cadastral layers that are the
   whole problem. So the text names WFS layers specifically and says the background maps are fine.

   ⚠ The trigger is the MEASURED duration of a full queue cycle, not a feature count. A count
   threshold would be a number invented on this machine and shipped to every other one; seconds
   are what the user experiences, and the same figure means the same thing on any device.
   It is deliberately NOT silenceable — the condition is not a preference to be dismissed, it is
   a state that will keep costing until something is switched off. But it carries a cooldown:
   without one it would fire after every gesture, and an unsilenceable dialog that reappears every
   few seconds is worse than the slowness it describes. */
/* This is the one number here that is NOT measured, and it is worth saying so: there is no field
   sample of a slow cycle to calibrate against, because in the jammed session no cycle ever closed.
   What IS measured is the healthy case — a refresh of 12 layers and 376 features closes in 0.4 s.
   So the bar sits at thirty times a normal refresh. It was 5 s and fired on the opening load, which
   is now excluded outright; between the two changes a false alarm needs a refresh thirty times
   slower than any yet observed. */
const _WFS_SLOW_CYCLE_MS = 12000;
/* The opening load gets its own, far higher bar rather than an exemption. Exempting it outright
   was the first attempt and it had a hole: the flag that marks the opening load as over is only set
   when that cycle CLOSES, and in the 16:26 field session no cycle ever closed — so a session that
   jams from the very first load would have gone through it in silence, which is the original bug
   back again in the worst case. With a bar instead, a normal opening load stays quiet and a jammed
   one still speaks up. Not measured either: no clean sample of a healthy opening load exists yet,

   report showed what that measures — "0.0 s (7 layers, 32 features)". With the requests running in
   parallel their replies arrive spread out, so the parse queue drains between them and the "cycle"
   was timing one parse in isolation, never the wait. It could not have crossed a 5 s threshold at
   all, which is why the notice never appeared however long the map took to fill. */
/* ⚠⚠ And the second field report showed the OPPOSITE failure. Ending the cycle only when nothing
   is in flight and nothing is queued is correct as a measurement and useless as a trigger: with
   thirteen layers and a user who keeps panning and turning, every gesture that leaves the fetched
   box fires thirteen fresh requests, so the quiet moment the cycle waits for never comes. The
   report logged EIGHT cycles when the bug was "ends too early" and ZERO across three and a half
   minutes of a jammed map — the notice cannot fire on an event that never happens.
   So the notice no longer waits for the cycle to close. A watchdog armed when the cycle opens

     Measured on the bench: a 45 degree turn plus 18x12 px of drift cost 2 _update and 2 full
     replaces with two WFS layers loaded, and the field device carries five.
     It closes the toast flood as well, and that is not a coincidence: three of those five layers

  /* The area to ask for. Mirrors _WMSImageLayer._requestBounds and exists for the same reason:
     the viewport envelope is bearing-DEPENDENT — 412x915 at 0 degrees, 938x938 at 45 — so a
     region fetched at one bearing cannot cover the screen at the next. Rotation itself fires no
     moveend, so nothing is asked for while the map turns; the refetch lands at the END of the
     gesture, when the fingers drift a few pixels and the envelope no longer matches. One rebuild
     per turn, which is what consecutive rotations looked like from the field.
     The circumscribed square is bearing-INDEPENDENT: once fetched, no turn uncovers it.
     Two differences from the WMS, both because a WFS box means FEATURES and not pixels:
     - The square is refused at or below the layer's own minZoom, and refused whenever it would
       reach further than one zoom level of the plain request. One level out doubles the ground
       per pixel, and the layer already accepts asking for that much at minZoom, so this never
       asks for more ground than the layer is already willing to ask for. The comparison is made
       in METRES at runtime rather than assumed: the inequality behind it (w²+h² < 4wh) holds
       only for screen aspect ratios between about 1:3.7 and 3.7:1 — true of every phone, not
       true by definition, and this must not become another constant tuned to one device.
     - It is padded like the plain request, and the pad is what makes it work at all: the screen
       corners sit at exactly half a diagonal from the centre, which is the square's inscribed
       radius, so a bare square has ZERO margin against the pan that ends a two-finger gesture.
       The pad turns that into ~100 px of slack against the 18x12 px measured on the bench. */

        /* ===== CHUNKED BUILD =====
           Building the whole answer in one L.geoJSON() call is a single synchronous block, and
           with the ceiling at 1000 features per layer and thirteen layers answering at once that
           block is what the field session hit: about two minutes during which the browser drew
           nothing and queued every tap — the compass tap included, which is why it only took
           effect after the freeze had already passed.
           Measured on the bench, a 2000-feature reply costs ~1700 ms end to end. Chunking does not
           make that work smaller — the total is the same or a shade worse for the scheduling — it
           makes it INTERRUPTIBLE: between chunks the browser paints a frame and collects input,
           so the map keeps answering while it fills.
           Features are added nearest-the-centre first, so what fills in first is what the user is
           looking at. Distance is taken from a feature's FIRST coordinate rather than its true
           centroid, or even its bounding box: those need a walk over every vertex, which is a
           second pass of the same order as the parse this exists to break up. For cadastral
           parcels — small and compact — the two orderings are indistinguishable on screen.
           ⚠ The previous layer is swapped at the END, exactly as before. Dropping it up front
           would be simpler and is wrong: the viewport refresh runs about once a second under GPS
           follow, and the map would blink empty every time. So progressive filling is what the
           user sees on a layer's FIRST load; a refresh keeps the old features until the new set
           is complete. */
        /* The budget caps FEATURES and VERTICES, because the two costs are separate and either
           one alone can blow a chunk. Measured on the bench: adding to a live L.geoJSON costs
           ~0.25 ms per feature plus ~0.0027 ms per vertex. So 150 small parcels of 20 vertices
           build in ~25 ms, while 24 contour lines of 2500 vertices — sixty times FEWER features —
           take 167 ms. A feature cap alone would have waved that second case through as a single
           chunk, which is exactly the case the field session hit. Both numbers are set to the same
           ~50 ms target, the threshold at which the browser itself calls a task long.
           A feature bigger than the whole budget is still added on its own: a geometry cannot be
